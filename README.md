# Video GPT Project

## Overview

Welcome to the **Video GPT** repository. This project focuses on video caption generation using advanced models and techniques to process videos efficiently. Our system is built to handle large video files by reducing and eliminating redundant frames, leveraging models like **InternV2**, and generating summarized text from the remaining frames.

## Demo Link
You can access the prototype of Video GPT project here : [Demo Link](https://jayanth119.github.io/The-Challangers/)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

- **development/**: Contains the core functionalities under active development.
  - **frame_reduction/**: Modules to reduce video frames.
  - **redundant_frame_elimination/**: Scripts to eliminate redundant frames from videos.
  - **internv2_model/**: Implementation of the **InternV2** model for processing redundant frames.
  - **text_summarization/**: Summarizes text based on the processed frames.

- **production/**: Holds the web interface and all code ready for deployment.
  - **web_interface/**: The front-end and back-end for the Video GPT web application.

- **research/**: Contains experimental scripts and files for ongoing research and model improvements.
  - **models_experiments/**: Files related to exploring and refining video-to-text models.

## Key Features

- **Frame Reduction**: Efficiently reduces the number of frames in a video to optimize processing time.
- **Redundant Frame Elimination**: Identifies and removes frames that do not add value to the video's context.
- **InternV2 Model**: Utilizes the InternV2 model for redundant frame analysis and processing.
- **Text Summarization**: Automatically generates text summaries from the optimized video frames.

This structure integrates both the **Video GPT** features and the organization of components like development, production, and research folders.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/videogpt.git
    ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd videogpt
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Follow the respective folder README files for setting up individual components.

## Usage

### Development

For development purposes, you can start by exploring the individual functionalities under the `development/` folder. Each module comes with its own README and usage instructions.

### Production

To run the web interface, navigate to the `production/web_interface/` folder, and follow the setup guide to launch the Video GPT web application.

## Research

All ongoing experiments and research efforts are located under the `research/` folder. This includes experiments with different models and optimization techniques.
